function centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)
%first zeros the K x N centroids matrix
%get centroids by finding all the data points for each centroid and getting the mean of all X 
%do a for loop from 1 to K = number of clusters
%return centroids matrix with a dimension of K x n where K = number of clusters and n=columns of matrix X


% Useful variables
