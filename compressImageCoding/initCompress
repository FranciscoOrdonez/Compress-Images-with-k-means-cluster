% load into A three dimensional matrix from the image with imread
A = double(imread('garden.jpg'));

A = A / 255; % Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1
% a way to check it values are from 0 to one is size(find(A>0)) and size(find(A<0))
% if both are 128x128x3= 49152 (if size A has these dimensions) there all values un A are ok

% Size of the image
img_size = size(A);

%change the dimensiones of A from a three dimensional to a two dimensional 
% where the first dimension is the multiplication of first two dimensiones of A
% and the second dimension es the same size as A
% example: if A = 128 x 128 x 3,  then X is 16384 X 3
X = reshape(A, img_size(1) * img_size(2), 3);

% set K = number of colors to compress.  Example K = 16 will cluster into 16 colors
K = 16;

%set maximun iterations.. it is the number of iterations to find the correct cluster
maxIter = 10;

% get the first clusters randomly.
% first initiatize matrix centroids to zeros with dimensiones K x size(X,2) 
centroids = zeros(K, size(X, 2));

%Randomly reorder the indicies of examples. Creates a matri randidx with the size of m=number of data points,
%with a number from 1 to m randomly.... for example is X has 400 data points, then creates randomly numbers indistinctly from 1 to 400
like [201  2  156 .....]
randidx = randperm(size(X,1));

% Take the first K examples from de randidx matrix and put the values of X corresponding to the first K values of randidex.
%example:  if randidx has [201 2 156 ...] and X(201) = (0.1 0.2), X(2) = (0.3 0.40) and X(156) = (0.5 0.6) then centroids are (0.1 0.2; 0.3 0.4; 0.5 0.6)
centroids = X(randidx(1:K),:);
